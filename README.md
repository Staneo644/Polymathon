This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

In order for the project to work you need to have a .env.local file at the root containing :

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
WORD_OF_THE_DAY_PER_DAY=
```

Then run the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
